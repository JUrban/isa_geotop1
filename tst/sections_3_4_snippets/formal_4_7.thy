(** from \<S>4 Theorem 7 (geotop.tex:1002)
    LATEX VERSION: Let J be a 1-sphere in R^2. Then R^2 - J has only one bounded component. **)
theorem Theorem_GT_4_7:
  fixes J :: "(real^2) set"
  assumes hJ: "geotop_is_n_sphere J (subspace_topology UNIV geotop_euclidean_topology J) 1"
  shows "card {C. geotop_bounded_R2 C \<and>
            (\<exists>P\<in>UNIV - J.
               C = geotop_component_at UNIV geotop_euclidean_topology (UNIV - J) P)} = 1"
  (** Moise proof (geotop.tex:1004): As in the proof of 4.3, embed J \<subset> \<bar>I\<close>
      polyhedral 2-cell with J \<inter> Fr I = {P,R}; decompose J = A\<^sub>1 \<union> A\<^sub>2 along P,R.
      Broken line B from S to Q in \<bar>I\<close> meeting Fr I only at endpoints.
      Define T, X, Y, Z, W as in Fig 4.9. Z lies in a bounded component of R\<^sup>2 - J.
      Let B\<^sub>1,\<dots>,B\<^sub>5 be the segments S-T-X-Y-W-Q, B' = \<Union>B\<^sub>i.
      P, R are limit points of different components of I - B'.
      If U is a bounded component of R\<^sup>2 - J distinct from Z's component, then
      U \<inter> B' = \<emptyset>, so Fr U cannot contain both P and R, hence Fr U \<subset> arc of J,
      contradicting Theorem 5 (every point of J is a limit point of both I and E). **)
