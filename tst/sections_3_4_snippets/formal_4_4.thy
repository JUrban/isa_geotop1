    LATEX VERSION: Let I, P, Q, R, S be as before, and let A_1 and A_2 be disjoint arcs in \<bar>I\<close>,
    with A_1 \<inter> Fr I = {P} and A_2 \<inter> Fr I = {R}. Then S and Q are in the frontier of the
    same component of I - (A_1 \<union> A_2). **)

  (** Moise proof sketch (geotop.tex:931-ff.): after reducing to the rectangular
      picture, choose a sufficiently fine brick-decomposition of the plane so that
      \<bar>I\<close> is a union of bricks and no brick meets both A\<^sub>1 and A\<^sub>2. Let N be the
      union of bricks meeting A\<^sub>1 and N' = N \<inter> \<bar>I\<close>. The component J' of Fr N'
      containing P is a 1-sphere. Its two boundary broken lines determine a
      sub-broken-line B with B \<inter> Fr I = {V,W}; V,W lie in the frontier of one
      component of I - (A\<^sub>1 \<union> A\<^sub>2). The cyclic order then transfers this frontier
      statement from V,W to Q,S. **)
