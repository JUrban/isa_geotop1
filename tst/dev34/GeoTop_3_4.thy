section \<open>\<S>4 The Jordan curve theorem\<close>

text \<open>The goal of this section: Let J be a topological 1-sphere in R^2. Then R^2 - J is
  the union of two disjoint connected sets I and E, such that J = Fr I = Fr E.\<close>

(** from \<S>4 Theorem 1 (geotop.tex:865)
    LATEX VERSION: Let U be an open set in R^n, and let P, Q \<in> U. If P and Q are in different
      components of U, then U is the union of two disjoint open sets containing P and Q. **)
(** Helper: every component of an open set in R^n is open. Moise \<S>4 Theorem 1
    proof pivots on this fact. Key idea: each x in comp_U(P) has a ball neighborhood
    in U which is convex hence connected, and thus contained in comp_U(x) = comp_U(P). **)

      L4: Every edge lies in \<le> 2 2-simplexes (else 2 semicircles form a
          1-sphere not separating its plane-nbhd, contradicting Jordan).
      L5: |L(v)| is connected (v does not separate its plane-nbhd |St v|).
      From L1: L(v) \<noteq> \<emptyset>. From L2-L4: each component of |L(v)| is a polygon.

      that lie in only one 2-simplex of K. **)

  (** Moise proof (geotop.tex:1054): As in Theorem 8, #(2-simplexes containing

      |L(v)| connected (L5). So |L(v)| is a single broken line or polygon. St v
      is a combinatorial 2-cell.
